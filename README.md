# Recruitment of the Sphere iOS team

Thank you for choosing to apply to Sphere for our iOS job opening.

## What we value
We value your potential and ability to adapt, as much as what you have already learnt in your previous tenure. During our technical interview session, we will try to access you in these areas:

* Your knowledge in iOS development

  This includes the Swift programming language and the Apple platform APIs.

* Your knowledge in software engineering

  This includes architectural patterns and understanding of typical software development cycle.

For transparency, we do use the architectural patterns and technologies listed below. We do not expect you to demonstrate knowledge in them, just that we hope you would be clear about what the job will entail, and would be interested in learning them as part of it.

* Declarative UI (with Apple SwiftUI)
* Functional reactive programming (with ReactiveSwift)
* Unidirectional data flows (e.g., Swift Composable Architecture)
* Kotlin Multiplatform
* SQLite

## The process

1. The hiring manager will first have a conversation with you. If both sides are happy to proceed, we will enter the Demo Project stage.

2. The Demo Project stage includes three paths. Choose the one path which you think you will do best in:

   * [The Babylon Health iOS demo project](https://github.com/babylonhealth/iOS-Interview-Demo/blob/a782537745dc080eb9583b9f3619b21995861017/demo.md)

      * We recommend using latest tooling to complete the project, or in general, Swift 5.2+ and Xcode 12.

   * A previous tech demo project which you have already put hard work in
   * An open source project which you have substantially contributed to

   We will review your submission and then decide whether or not we should proceed to a face-to-face (F2F) interview stage.

3. The F2F interview stage will involve non-technical sessions with our senior staff, and also a technical session with the iOS team.

   The technical session will last for 90-120 minutes. We will start with a pairing session revolving around your project submission, that might involve (but not limited to) refactoring for improvement, improving test coverage, and conversations about design choices you have made.
   
   After that, we will move onto a general conversation around techincal knowledge you have in the aforementioned areas. You may refer to [the Babylon Health iOS interview question bank](https://github.com/babylonhealth/iOS-Interview-Demo/blob/a782537745dc080eb9583b9f3619b21995861017/questions.md) for a rough idea of what questions you can expect.
