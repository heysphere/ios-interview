Sphere iOS recruitment process
==================================

At Sphere, we believe that **transparency** is a core value that should be present in everything we do, and hiring should reflect that belief. This is why we adopted the open-source recruitment process from [the Babylon Health iOS team](https://github.com/babylonhealth/iOS-Interview-Demo), for an assessment process in which candidates know what to expect, including the [sample questions which we may ask during a face-to-face interview](questions.md).

We also aim to be as flexible as possible by equally accepting quality applications from candidates who have a limited amount of time to write a demo project, or who have open-source contributions.

### Our expectations

We value **potential** equally as much as **knowledge** and **experience**. We value one's ability to think independently and to engage constructively, and are fun to work with. After all, we will be spending lots of time together in work days.

These are the main areas the iOS team will focus our assessment of candidates on:

- Technical expertise
  - The Swift programming language
  - Architectural design patterns (MVVM, Swift TCA, unidirectional data flow, etc)
  - Knowledge of declarative UI programming, e.g., Apple SwiftUI
  - Knowledge of Apple platform APIs, in particular UIKit for iOS and macOS
  - Knowledge of reactive programming (RxSwift, ReactiveSwift, Combine, etc)
  - Knowledge of the development cycle
  - Interview demo project
- Interest in sharing one's knowledge, learning new knowledge, and keeping oneself up to date
- Ability to think and work independently
- Ability to work in a large team
- Professional and personal maturity
- Overall attitude
- Likelihood of fitting in well with the company's culture
- Is the candidate someone we would like to work with on a daily basis?

### The iOS recruitment process

As indicated above, we expect all candidates to submit an ["interview demo project"](demo.md). However, in order to be accommodating of different schedules, we provide two alternatives in which a candidate can submit a demo of their work. **You can choose any one of the three options, whichever you think you will do best in**.

1. The ["interview demo project"](demo.md);
2. A project you've already done; or
3. An open source project you've done or substantially contributed to.

A demo project should be an example of one's **best** work â€” we think it is best for you to decide how to demonstrate your technical skills and creativity on your own terms. Note that we do not have a submission deadline so take your time to polish your demo project.

If we then think the demo project is interesting enough, we'll proceed to a full face-to-face interview.

That face-to-face step, which normally lasts 90-120 minutes per session (there may be more than one), typically starts with a discussion around the candidate's project. We normally ask the candidate to implement a new feature (even if it's just using pseudo-code), or to refactor and unit-test a particular component, and in general we aim to have an informal discussion about the candidate's approach.

We may also focus on more technical aspects and ask a range of technical questions. As indicated earlier, we have open-sourced these questions as well since we believe that a fully open recruitment process gives all candidates a fairer chance to prepare themselves, and makes our assessment uniform across all candidates.

Above all, be yourself and thank you for taking the time to apply to Sphere! ðŸŒˆ

**We look forward to hearing from you!**
